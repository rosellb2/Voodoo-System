 *                 Voodoo Control for RobotGeek Snapper Arm
 *                      Lesson 2: Let's Smooth it out!
 * This sketch will show you a way to smooth out the movement of the arm by way of
 * delaying the motion for a fraction of a second. To do this, we hold on to the
 * current position, look for a new position, and have the arm move between them
 * in an incremental motion instead of having the arm constantly keeping up with new
 * position data. We are starting to see the need to compress our code at this point,
 * as the pattern used to handle data keeps repeating. We'll handle that after we get
 * it working properly here.
 * 
 * Voodoo Connections:
 * Analog 0  - RobotGeek Rotation Knob (Base)
 * Analog 1  - RobotGeek Rotation Knob (Shoulder)
 * Analog 2  - RobotGeek Rotation Knob (Elbow)
 * Analog 3  - RobotGeek Rotation Knob (Wrist)
 * Digital 2 - RobotGeek Pushbutton    (Gripper)
 * 
 * RobotGeek Snapper Connections:
 * Digital 3  - RobotGeek 180 Servo (Base)
 * Digital 5  - RobotGeek 180 Servo (Shoulder)
 * Digital 6  - RobotGeek 180 Servo (Elbow)
 * Digital 9  - RobotGeek 180 Servo (Wrist)
 * Digital 10 - RobotGeek 180 Servo (Gripper)
 * 
 * Set both of the jumpers on the RobotGeek Sensor Shield to VIN.
